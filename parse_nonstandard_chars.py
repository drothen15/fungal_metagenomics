"""Somewhat hackish way to eliminate non-ASCII characters in a text file,
such as a taxonomy mapping file, with QIIME. Reads through the file, and 
removes all characters above decimal value 127. Additionally, asterisk "*"
characters are removed, as these inhibit the RDP classifier.
Usage:
python parse_nonstandard_chars.py X > Y
where X is the input file to be parsed, and Y is the output parsed file"""
